# IMPORTANT
NOTE: If you are looking at the source - please run build.bat before opening the solution. It creates the SolutionVersion.cs file that is necessary for a successful build.

# INFO
## Overview
Warmup allows you to define templates for entire projects and change them as technology changes and you learn new things. The templates are kept in source control. Both SVN and Git are supported places to keep your templates.

## Getting started with Warmup

In the location you want the new solution to reside in, run:

  [warmuppath]warmup.exe [template] [newSolutionName]

Ensure that the warmup.exe.config filehas the correct path to your templates.
